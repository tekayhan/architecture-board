# HBC Architecture Board

## Introduction & Objectives

The objective of the Architecture Board is to facilitate a broader conversation with the engineers at HBC who are making daily decisions on the technology they are using within their teams. We also hope to make the overall discussion of architecture more inclusive and more transparent.

## Goals & Responsibilities

The Architecture Board comprises of the most senior engineers and leaders in the engineering organisations of HBC Tech. It’s responsibilities are:

* To maintain a Tech Radar to provide recommendations to engineering teams on technologies and trends to hold, assess, trial or adopt.
* Assess specific technologies - both already at HBC or not yet in use at HBC
* To maintain a small set of standards and technologies that all team should adhere to when working across team boundaries.
* Establish an annual review to ensure all standards are actively reviewed annually.
* Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
* Highlight best practices across all our teams
* Minimise duplication of effort across HBC Tech
* Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways
* Establish an RFC (Request For Comments) process so that engineering teams can get rapid feedback on proposed architectures.
* Publish and maintain a simple means to contact the board for help with issues and visibility of the feedback loop through to resolution.
* Establish and nurture technology Guilds across HBC Tech for where specialist technologies can be debated in a birds-of-a-feather setting.

Members of the board are formed from teams across HBC Tech, and are available to provide the Architect Ingredient to initiative teams in their department / domain.

While the Architecture Board is designed to have influence and impact on the overall architecture at HBC Tech, it does not have authority over engineering teams, who can choose to ignore board recommendations but must live with the ramifications.

## Scope

The board’s remit covers a wider range of technologies and functional areas of HBC Tech, including but not limited to the list below:

* Mobile Technology, Mobile App Design
* Security
* Frontend Common Platform
* Frontend Gilt Platform
* Backend / Scala
* AWS
* Infra
* Database
* Data Science
* ML
* Back-office Systems
* Payments

## Governance

The board reports to SVP Engineering. The Architecture Board is governed by The Chair of the Board, whose responsibilities include:

* Convening regular board meetings as necessary and at least twice per month.
* Share agenda + minutes with all of tech from each board meeting - most important here is to make transparent all of the decisions, non decisions, and discussions
* Convene Architecture Councils We believe that a good way to accomplish the goals of the board is to facilitate periodic in person meetings which we are calling Architecture Councils. All engineers are invited to these meetings. We alternate the host location between Dublin and New York (engineers not based in the host location can join via GVC). We expect to convene these meetings for all engineers and architects to share best practices every six months. Example of agenda items for the architecture councils:
* Review key RFCs - Design reviews for systems we admire
* Discussion of a proposal on standards that the arch board is preparing
* Workshops for architecture topics of general interest

## Membership and Structure of the Board

* The Directors of Engineering, Principal Engineers, Distinguished Engineers, and Architects of HBC Tech constitute the permanent members of the architecture board.
* One member of the board will serve as Chair. The chair is elected by the members of the Architecture Board to a one-year term.
* Attendance at board meetings is voluntary, however each department should be represented by at least one member.
* All board members continue to serve as first class team members as their primary role.
* Tech exec and team management will encourage teams to actively plan time for architecture into all ongoing work.

In order to ensure broad technical and departmental representation, the board may appoint additional members at any point.

* Additional members are proposed by the Chair, after consultation with the respective department leads/directors.
* The board decides on the proposed members via majority vote.
* Additional board members are given a permanent seat on the board.
* Additional members are free to voluntarily give up their seat on the board.

## Board Meetings

* Each engineering department can decide which board members) should represent the department at board meetings. This does not have to be the same person every time.
* The main goal of the meetings is to share information as well as discuss and decide on architectural topics that affect the entire tech organisation.
* The meeting agenda should be distributed in advance of every meeting.
* All members can raise topics to be discussed at board meetings.
* Core decisions should be minuted, and any changes to constitution or board tech recommendations should be recorded via pull request on the board's github repositories.

## Decision-making process

* Decisions by the board must be announced at least one week in advance via email to the architecture board google group arch-board@hbc.com to give all members enough time to prepare and a chance to attend the meeting when the decision is made.
* All members present at the board meeting when the decision is made, can vote.
* The SVP Engineering acts as a Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) has passive membership on the architecture board with no voting rights, but has the right to veto decisions.
* Decisions are made via majority vote.
* In case of a stalemate, the chair has the deciding vote.

## Guilds

Often sub-architectures or technologies are shared across different departments of the organisation (e.g. front-end technologies, payments, data-platform) and it is desirable to create a regular forum for those architectures and technologies to be discussed by a smaller more focused group. These guilds are not governed, controlled or answerable to the Architecture Board; however, the architecture board should foster and nurture the growth of a healthy ecosystem of guilds throughout the organisation, and the representation of those guilds in the architecture board and participation in the Architecture Council.

## History

The first [HBC Architecture Board](https://github.com/saksdirect/architecture-board)  was established in late 2016 modelled on the [Gilt Architecture Board](https://github.com/gilt/arch-board) which was established in 2014. In 2017 these boards were disbanded and a new board to which this document refers to was created.
